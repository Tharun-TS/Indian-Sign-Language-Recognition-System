# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition-System
Every country has its own sign language with a high level of grammatical variations.The sign language exists in India is commonly known as Indian Sign Language. ISL is a complete natural language, found in India with its own morphology,phonology, syntax, and grammar. The objective of the proposed work is to efficiently recognize the signs of Indian Sign Language (ISL) and translate the accurate meaning of those recognized signs. In this project, we have proposed an Indian sign language recognition method, which is based on Convolutional NeuralNetworks(CNN). Our contribution considers a recognition system using convolutional neural networks(CNNs) and GPU acceleration. The model is comprised of one or more convolutional layers as in a standard multilayer neural network.  It implicitly extracts relevant features using a feed-forward technique. A classifier will use various neural network models to iscriminate between the different actions (or signs).  In this work, the automation of feature extraction is done using deep learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for classification.
